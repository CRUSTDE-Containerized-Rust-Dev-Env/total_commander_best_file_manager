# total_commander_best_file_manager
I make acrobatics with files all day long.  I could not live without TotalCommander - the best file manager.
## History
I am old. I don't feel it, but I am. I grew up with Sinclair Spectrum 48 and Commodore 64 computers.  
I was already very productive in the old DOS times. There was a magic tool everybody used: Norton Commander.
It was very difficult to be productive without it. Can you imagine typeing folder/file names all day? Just plain crazy! 
DOS was slowly dying and the new star of graphic user interface Windows emmerged. It had a nice looking File Manager.  
But it was a game for kinds, not a true tool. You learned about click, doubleclick, drag&drop. Fine. Totally useless for practical pruporses.  
Then a Swiss guy Ghisler had this idea to make a Norton Commander, but for Windows. Fantastic. Great tool.  
He called it Windows Commander. After a few years he had a phone call from microsoft that windows is their trademark.  
He renamed it ti Total Commander ot TotalCmd.  
I thing it is now 30 years I am using it and nothing comes close to it as a practical tool.
